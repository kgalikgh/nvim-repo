## Intro
This repository contains my Neovim config.
It's in a very early stage, changes will be made!

## Requirements
- Neovim v0.9+

## Installation
**Note:** remember to backup your neovim config (if you have any) before installation of any other config.

Basically use: `git clone https://github.com/kgalikgh/nvim-repo.git ~/.config/nvim`.
